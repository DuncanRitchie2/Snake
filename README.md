# Java Snake
The game Snake in Java. 🐍🐍🐍

This is my first project with Swing. I based it on an example codebase from Stack Overflow, and adapted and refactored it to make it more elegant and easily modified.

Download out/artifacts/Snake_jar ( https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/java-snake/blob/master/out/artifacts/Snake_jar/Snake.jar ) to play the game. I promise it's not a virus!

Uses the arrow keys.
